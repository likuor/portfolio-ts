### Why made me create this app?

Have you ever seen tilting websites before? I was curious if they existed or not and how to created it. That was the first step and so fun to create however my neck hurts a lot because of tilting my head. To prevent to get hurt, click an icon of 3 lines it's floated on right bottom.

### What was challenging?

Understanding styled component passing state props with css motions. Type and interface of Typescript.
