    'When I was a university student , I backpacked to cross the States from NewYork to Seattle by hitchhiking and using sharerides by myself for 3 months. At the time, I experienced that apps have an incredibly helpful power and made us connect with each other easily to make us happy, make our dreams come true. That was the first step to make me big fun of the amazing IT world. After the survival traveling, I am always pleased that I would like to efficiently learn technologies to help people in the world with my huge passion!',
